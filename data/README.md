## Data

The original dataset and preprocessed arrays are not included in this repository due to size/licensing constraints.

Expected local structure:
- data/mars_for_students.npz  (original dataset provided by the course)
- data/preprocessed/          (generated by preprocessing)

Typical generated files used by the notebooks:
- data/preprocessed/training_set_oversampling.npy
- data/preprocessed/validation_set_aftersplit_crop.npy
- data/training_set.npy
- data/test_set.npy

Run `notebooks/01_preprocessing_with_split.ipynb` to generate the required files, then run training.
