To create a proper `csv` file, you need to flatten your predictions and include an `id` column as the first column of your dataframe. To maintain consistency between your results and our solution, please avoid shuffling the test set. The code below demonstrates how to prepare the `csv` file from your model predictions."],"metadata":{"id":"0abe5b72"}},{"id":"D1wLXrkDROrJ","cell_type":"code","source":["# If model_filename is not defined, load the most recent model from Google Drive\n","\n","if \"model_filename\" not in globals() or model_filename is None:\n","\n","    files = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isfile(f) and f.startswith('model_') and f.endswith('.keras')]\n","\n","    files.sort(key=lambda x: os.path.getmtime(x), reverse=True)\n","\n","    if files:\n","\n","        model_filename = files[0]\n","\n","    else:\n","\n","        raise FileNotFoundError(\"No model files found in the current directory.\")"],"metadata":{"id":"D1wLXrkDROrJ","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.039513Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.039775Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.044759Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.039750Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.043899Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"Ogcmt-HKRU7B","cell_type":"code","source":["model = tfk.models.load_model(model_filename, compile=False)\n","\n","print(f\"Model loaded from {model_filename}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"Ogcmt-HKRU7B","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.045905Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.046562Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.296775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.046523Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.295895Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"m0x435dRRXhI","cell_type":"code","source":["preds = model.predict(X_test)\n","\n","preds = np.argmax(preds, axis=-1)\n","\n","print(f\"Predictions shape: {preds.shape}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"m0x435dRRXhI","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.297852Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.298115Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.971672Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-05T12:00:20.298089Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.970787Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"0m1IW1cvRZBY","cell_type":"code","source":["def y_to_df(y) -> pd.DataFrame:\n","\n","    \"\"\"Converts segmentation predictions into a DataFrame format for Kaggle.\"\"\"\n","\n","    n_samples = len(y)\n","\n","    y_flat = y.reshape(n_samples, -1)\n","\n","    df = pd.DataFrame(y_flat)\n","\n","    df[\"id\"] = np.arange(n_samples)\n","\n","    cols = [\"id\"] + [col for col in df.columns if col != \"id\"]\n","\n","    return df[cols]"],"metadata":{"id":"0m1IW1cvRZBY","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.972886Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.973597Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.978805Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.973551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.977791Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"DbcECRgURarI","cell_type":"code","source":["# Create and download the csv submission file\n","\n","timestep_str = model_filename.replace(\"model_\", \"\").replace(\".keras\", \"\")\n","\n","os.makedirs(\"submissions\", exist_ok=True)\n","\n","submission_filename = f\"submissions/submission_{timestep_str}.csv\"\n","\n","submission_df = y_to_df(preds)\n","\n","submission_df.to_csv(submission_filename, index=False)\n","\n","\n","\n","if IN_COLAB:\n","\n","    from google.colab import files\n","\n","    files.download(submission_filename)"],"metadata":{"id":"DbcECRgURarI","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.979764Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.980038Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-05T12:00:53.797952Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-05T12:00:31.980013Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-05T12:00:53.797092Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
